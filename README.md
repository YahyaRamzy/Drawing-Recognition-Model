# Drawing-Recognition-Model
 Deploy Drawing Recognition model on AWS . It predict the animal by taking the user's input in drawing form. 
 USING CNN , I HAVE  CREATED A DEEP LEARNING MODEL WHICH IS ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE DRAWING MADE BY THE USER .
 IN SIMPLE TERM , IT ACTUALLY TAKE DRAWING AS A INPUT AND RETURN THE NAME OF THE ANIMAL MADE BY THE USER .
 I HAVE ONLY TRAINED THIS MODEL FOR ONLY SIX ANIMALS .
 I HAVE TAKEN ALL THE DATA SET  FROM QUICK DRAW GAME .
 I HAVE ALSO USED FLASK , WHICH HELP ME TO DEPLOY MY MODEL ON LOCAL SERVER AS WELL AS ON AMAZON WEB SERVICE (AWS)
